## üîç What Are Web Vulnerabilities?
Web vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in a web application's design, implementation, or configuration that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or compromise systems.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Web Vulnerabilities
### 1. SQL Injection
- **Description**: Attackers inject malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate databases.
- **Example**:  
  Normal query:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'lamiss' AND password = 'mypassword';
  ```  
  Injected query:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1--' AND password = '';
  ```
- **Impact**: Data breaches, unauthorized access, and database manipulation.

---

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Description**: Injecting malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into websites to execute in users' browsers.
- **Example**:  
  ```html
  <img src="x" onerror="alert(1)">
  <button onclick="alert('Hacked!')">Click Me!</button>
  ```
- **Impact**: Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.

---

### 3. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Description**: Exploiting a server to send unauthorized requests to internal/external systems.
- **Impact**: Accessing internal systems or escalating privileges.

---

### 4. Broken Authentication
- **Description**: Flaws in authentication mechanisms allow attackers to bypass login systems.
- **Impact**: Account takeovers and data breaches.

---

## üíª Exploitation Techniques
Exploitation involves using tools and methods to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. Examples:
- Crafting malicious SQL queries for **SQL Injection**.
- Injecting scripts in forms for **XSS**.
- Redirecting server requests in **SSRF**.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies
1. **Input Validation**: Use parameterized queries and sanitize user input.
2. **Output Encoding**: Encode data to prevent XSS.
3. **Access Controls**: Restrict sensitive resources to authorized users.
4. **Regular Updates**: Patch software and libraries to fix known vulnerabilities.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools for Web Exploitation
The following tools are widely used for penetration testing:
- **Burp Suite**: A powerful platform for web application security testing.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Open-source penetration testing tool.
- **SQLmap**: Automates SQL injection discovery and exploitation.
- **Dirbuster/Dirb**: For directory and file brute-forcing.
- **Nikto**: A web server scanner for detecting vulnerabilities.
- **Shodan**: A search engine for devices and exposed systems.

---

## üåç Real-World Examples
1. **Equifax Breach (2017)**: Exploited an Apache Struts vulnerability to expose sensitive data of over 140 million individuals.
2. **Facebook Data Exposure**: A misconfigured database allowed unauthorized access to user information.

---

## üö® Why It Matters
Understanding web vulnerabilities is essential for:
- Preventing financial and reputational damage.
- Protecting sensitive user data.
- Building secure web applications and infrastructures.
